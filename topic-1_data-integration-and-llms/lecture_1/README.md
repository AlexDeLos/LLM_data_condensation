# Lecture 1: Introduction to LLMs and related concepts

## Overview

This lecture provides an introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs) and related concepts. Students will learn about the basics of LLMs, how they work, and their capabilities and limitations.

This is mostly a "theoretical" lecture. We will not use any code in this lecture but instead a set of slide contained in the `lecture_1` folder.
