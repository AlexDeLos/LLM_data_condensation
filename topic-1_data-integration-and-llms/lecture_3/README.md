# Lecture 3: Structured Outputs from LLMs

## Overview

This lecture focuses on extracting structured, reliable data from Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs naturally generate unstructured text, modern applications often require structured outputs like JSON objects, validated data schemas, or specific formats. Students will learn how to move from free-form text generation to predictable, parseable outputs that can be integrated into larger software systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

- Understand the importance of structured outputs in production LLM applications
- Compare classical structured programming approaches with LLM text generation
- Extract JSON data from LLM responses using manual parsing techniques
- Create and validate data schemas using Pydantic models
- Use LangChain's structured output features for reliable data extraction
- Build robust pipelines that combine LLM intelligence with structured data requirements

## Lecture Materials Index

### 1. Classical Programming vs. LLM Outputs
**üìÅ File:** [`0_classical_vs_llm_structure.md`](0_classical_vs_llm_structure.md)

Reflect on how traditional software handles structured data and compare it with the challenges of extracting structure from LLM-generated text.

**Key Topics:**
- Structured data in classical programming
- Challenges with unstructured LLM outputs
- Why structure matters in production systems
- Trade-offs between flexibility and reliability

---

### 2. Manual JSON Parsing from LLMs
**üìÅ File:** [`1_manual_prompting.md`](1_manual_prompting.md)

Learn foundational techniques for extracting JSON data from LLM responses, including prompt engineering and robust parsing strategies.

**Key Topics:**
- Prompting for JSON output
- Handling malformed JSON responses
- Error handling and retry strategies
- Performance considerations

**Exercise:** Build a JSON extractor for research paper metadata

---

### 3. Introduction to Pydantic Models
**üìÅ File:** [`2_pydantic_fundamentals.md`](2_pydantic_fundamentals.md)

Master Pydantic for data validation and schema definition, creating the foundation for reliable structured outputs.

**Key Topics:**
- Pydantic model basics and syntax
- Type annotations and validation
- Field decorators and constraints
- Nested models and complex structures
- Error handling and validation messages

**Exercise:** Create medical record validation schemas

### 4. LangChain Structured Outputs ‚Äî Pharmacology Edition
**üìÅ File:** [`3_langchain_structured_outputs_pharmacology.md`](3_langchain_structured_outputs_pharmacology.md)

Leverage LangChain's structured output features with domain examples from pharmacology. You'll combine LLM generation with Pydantic validation and see unions and nested schemas in action.

**Key Topics:**
- `with_structured_output()` method
- Pydantic integration in LangChain
- Union types for variant schemas (e.g., oral vs injectable)
- Nested models and simple validators
- `PydanticOutputParser` usage

**Exercise:** Build a medication data extraction pipeline

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Lecture 2 (LLM APIs and LangChain)
- Python programming experience
- Basic understanding of JSON and data structures
- Familiarity with type hints (helpful but not required)


## Getting Started

1. **Foundation:** Begin with [`0_classical_vs_llm_structure.md`](0_classical_vs_llm_structure.md) to understand the conceptual framework
2. **Manual Techniques:** Work through [`1_manual_prompting.md`](1_manual_prompting.md) for foundational skills
3. **Schema Design:** Master [`2_pydantic_fundamentals.md`](2_pydantic_fundamentals.md) for robust data validation
4. **Framework Integration:** Apply [`3_langchain_structured_outputs_pharmacology.md`](3_langchain_structured_outputs_pharmacology.md) for production-ready solutions

## Practical Applications

This lecture prepares you for real-world scenarios such as:

- **Research Data Extraction:** Automatically extracting structured metadata from scientific papers
- **Medical Information Processing:** Converting clinical notes into structured medical records
- **Business Intelligence:** Transforming unstructured reports into analyzable data
- **Content Management:** Extracting structured metadata from documents and media
- **API Integration:** Creating reliable interfaces between LLMs and downstream systems

## Note on Model Capabilities

Different LLM providers have varying levels of support for structured outputs. Some models (like newer OpenAI models) have native structured output modes, while others require careful prompt engineering. This lecture covers techniques that work across different providers.

## Course Context

This lecture is part of **Topic 1: Data Integration and LLMs** in the VIB ML Summer School 2025. It bridges the gap between basic LLM usage (Lecture 2) and advanced data integration techniques that will be covered in subsequent lectures.
