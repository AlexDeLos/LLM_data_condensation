## Project overview

In this project, we will explore how LLMs can be applied to real-world
biological problems through a hands-on, hackathon-style approach. Starting from
a concrete biological question, we will guide participants in building a
functional prototype that leverages LLMs to interpret and connect diverse data
modalities. Key topics will include strategies to enhance model factuality and
knowledge access, such as vector-based retrieval and prompt-to-query methods. We
will also demonstrate how LLMs can interact with external tools to improve their
problem-solving capabilities and introduce techniques for generating structured
outputs. Crucially, evaluation methods for LLMs will be covered, with a focus on
relevance, coherence, and scientific utility. The project emphasizes a
practical, iterative mindset, encouraging participants to test, refine, and
critically assess their solutions. By the end, attendees will gain both
conceptual insight and hands-on experience in using LLMs as adaptable components
within biological data analysis workflows.
